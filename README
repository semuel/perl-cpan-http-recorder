HTTP::Recorder
--------------

WHAT THIS IS

This is a browser-independent recorder for recording interactions with
web sites.

INSTALLATION

Set HTTP::Recorder as the agent for your web proxy.

Optionally, it uses javascript to open a window to display the script.

PROBLEMS

This software is barely out of the "proof of concept" stage.  Caveat
user.
